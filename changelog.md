# Change Log to Portfolio Site

## Changes Made to Portfolio

- Attempted to make navigation bar not open as soon as a page loads up but couldn't figure it out
- Changed styling of the tables within my About Me and Experience pages
- Added a dynamic background that changes the image every 5 seconds. Unfortunately couldnt figure out the fade effect due to everything on the page fading in
- Added more up-to-date content on the About Me and Experience pages
- Updated styling on blog page
- Added links to parts 1-4 of HW4 on my navigation bar, and added navigation bars to each of those pages to navigate back to other pages if needed
- Added script for Google Analytics tracking to main pages of portfolio which would allow tracking of Page views, scrolls, outbound clicks, site search, and any form of engagement such as forms, video interactions and file downloads. 
- Added support which would allow me to track custom events or manage any incoming events or edit parameters for events if I wanted to in the future development of my site.
- Created account for Algolia for this site and tried integrating, but didnt seem to work and ran out of time.
